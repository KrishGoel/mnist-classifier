## Notes on how to get the dataset
GitHub has a limit on file upload size so I cannot upload the dataset directly in this repo. So head over to [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset), and store it in the same directory as the notebook in a sub-directory called `data`.
